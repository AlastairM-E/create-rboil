This is just a very simple React cli which generates a basic boilerplate react app.

If you are looking for a React CLI please try **_create-react-app_** npm package.

**CREATE RBOIL**

If you really want to use this significantly worse version of create-react-app, then please install yarn and run the package via the following command:

    yarn create rboil

**Issues & feature requests**

If you have any issues, please do submit an issue with the appropiate error messages and code you tried to executed and I will try to fix said bug.

If there is a feature you would like the cli to include, please make an issue on the github repository.

Note :
- I will try my best to complete the issues but I may not have the time to complete them right away.
- Please do not try to contribute to the project just yet.

**Basic Commands**

To create a basic development server use:

    yarn start

To build and minify your app use:

    yarn build

To test with using Jest and testing-library/react, use:

    yarn test
