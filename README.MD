This is just a very simple React cli which generates a basic boilerplate react app.

If you are looking for a React CLI please try **_create-react-app_** npm package.

**CREATE RBOIL**

If you really want to use this significantly worse version of create-react-app, then please install yarn and run the package via the following command:

    yarn create rboil

**Basic Commands**

To create a basic development server use:

    yarn start

To build and minify your app use:

    yarn build

One cannot use **yarn test** to test with jest currently. This issue will be resolved as soon as possible.

**Issues**

If you have any issues, please do submit an issue with the appropiate error messages and code you tried to executed and I will try to fix said bug.

Note :
- I will try my best to complete the issues but I may not have the time to complete them right away.
- Please do not try to contribute to the project just yet.
