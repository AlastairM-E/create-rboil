This is just a very simple React cli which generates a basic boilerplate react app.

If you are looking for a React CLI please try **_create-react-app_** npm package.

If you really want to use this significantly worse version of create-react-app, then please use yarn and run the package by:

    yarn create rboil

**Basic Commands**

To create a basic development server use:

    yarn start

To build and minify your app use:

    yarn build

To test you files with jest use:

    yarn test
